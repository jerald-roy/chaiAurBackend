1. **Authentication** (Who You Are) ‚Üí Confirms your identity (e.g., logging in with a password or Google).

2. **Authorization** (What You Can Do) ‚Üí Checks what permissions you have after logging in (e.g., can you edit a file or just view it?).

3. 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Traditional logins (username & password) were inconvenient and risky (password leaks).
2Ô∏è‚É£ OAuth 2.0 was created to let apps access user data without passwords (it issues tokens instead of storing passwords).
3Ô∏è‚É£ But OAuth 2.0 only handles authorization (permissions), not authentication (identity verification). i.e we were not able to create the new token we had to send extra info everytime along with the access token to the server
4Ô∏è‚É£ So, OpenID Connect (OIDC) was added on top of OAuth 2.0 to confirm who the user is before issuing tokens.i.e we now have the ability to create the new token without sending that extra info everytime we the access token 

In short:
üîπ OAuth 2.0 = "This app is allowed to access your data." (Authorization)
üîπ OIDC = "This user is really John." (Authentication)

Both work together to securely log in users and manage sessions without passwords!
